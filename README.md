## Prerequisites
- A registered domain name.
- A DNS record with `your_domain.com` pointing to your proxy serverâ€™s public IP address.


## Convenient commands
Run the production version:
```
sudo docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build -d
```
Migrate database:
```
sudo docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec django python manage.py migrate --noinput
```
Collect static files:
```
sudo docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec django python manage.py collectstatic
```

## Production security
To generate a secret key:
```
python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe())"
```

## Get certificates from Let's Encrypt with certbot
Before acquiring the certificates:
- Comment out everything having to do with https in the Nginx config file.
- Comment out the Redirect to HTTPS location in the http section.

Do a dry run to test:
```
sudo docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml run --rm  certbot certonly --webroot --webroot-path /var/www/certbot/ --dry-run -d spaceengineering.io
```
And if it works, without the `--dry-run`:
sudo docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml run --rm  certbot certonly --webroot --webroot-path /var/www/certbot/ -d spaceengineering.io
```

After the successful acquiring of certificates:
- Uncomment everything having to do with https in the Nginx config file.
- Comment out the location which proxies to Django in the http section.
- Comment out the location with static files in the http section.
